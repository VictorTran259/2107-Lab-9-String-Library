# CIS 2107 Lab 9 - String Library

## String Library
In this assignment, you'll create your own library of string functions. You'll have the opportunity to practice manipulating strings and managing memory. Additionally, you'll learn the role of header and library files. You may not call functions in string.h but you can use other code in the Standard C Library.
